# Note Taking React App


## General Plan 
- Note taking app 
	- store notes in local storage 
	- notes stored as array of objects, like the blog posts 
	- useContext for global access to notes 
	- useReducer for complex access to notes 
	- useLocalStorage for persistent access to notes 
	- useState for forms to make notes 
	- CSS styling in React 
		- useMedia hook for media queries in JSX 
		- Bootstrap or Material or Tailwind 
	- deployment to Netlify  (and then maybe GH Pages) 
	- Auth as local storage thing, maybe? 

## Data Structures / Models 

- Note data structure
	- ID (number)
	- title (string)
	- description (string)
	- isCompleted (boolean)
	- due date (JS Date)
	- created at date (JS Date)

## Development Plan

- Plan:
    - Routing:
        - useParams for routes to do things with/to specific notes
        - Routes to do:

Essential stuff: - / - Homepage 1. Display a count of how many notes exist 2. Create a note with a form on the page 3. List of all notes?

Nicer to have: - /notes - Lists all notes from newest to oldest - /notes/:noteID - Show a note - /notes/:noteID/edit - Show a note edit form - / - Homepage (extra functionality) - List newest note - List any notes due within 1 day

Nice to have: - /notes/sort/createddate - List all notes ordered by "created at date" - /notes/filter/overdue - List all notes with a "due date" in the past and with "isCompleted" set to false - /notes/filter/done - List all notes with "isCompleted" set to true - /notes/sort/duedate - List all notes ordered by "due date" - /notes - List all notes ordered by ID

```
		- /notes/searchByWord/:word
			- List all notes that include :word in title or description 

- components:
	- NoteDisplay
		- Show note data
		- Show edit button
		- Show delete button 
	- NoteForm
		- If a prop.noteID exists, show form pre-filled with note data 
		- Else, show an empty form with placeholder content 
		- Show submit/save button  
	- NoteContainer
		- Store state about display/edit mode
		- Toggle between NoteDisplay and NoteForm 
		- Contain a reference to a note via note ID 
	- NewestNoteDisplay
		- Logic to determine which note is newest and retrieve that data from global state
		- Show note data 
			- NoteContainer re-used here 
	- CountNoteDisplay
		- Logic to count how many notes exist in global state 
		- Show number
	- SortedNotesList
		- Logic to copy global state into local state and sort it
		- Properties to sort by are received as props 
		- List a bunch of NoteContainers based on the sorted data 
```
